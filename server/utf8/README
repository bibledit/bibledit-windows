This folder contains two UTF8 libraries.

1. http://grigory.info/UTF8Strings.About.html
This library is easy to use.
It causes Bibledit to crash during the unit tests.
Valgrind says: Mismatched free() / delete / delete [].

2. http://utfcpp.sourceforge.net
This library is harder to use.
The Bibledit wrappers make it easy to use.
It is valgrind-clean.
