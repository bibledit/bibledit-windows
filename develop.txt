There is a git repository on Windows 10 and there's one on on macOS. Keeping both repositories in sync ensure that the code and files on both operating systems are in sync.
Visual Studio 2015 is used on Windows for building Bibledit for Windows.
On macOS there's a script that refreshes the source of the Bibledit library.





How to include the SQlite library.
1. Download the native 32 or 64 bits SQLite DLL from http://sqlite.org.
2. Extract the files sqlite3.dll and sqlite3.def and place them in the project’s source folder.
3. Open a “Developer Command Prompt for VS2015” and navigate to this source folder.
4. Create an import library using the following command line: LIB /DEF:sqlite3.def
5. Add the library (that is sqlite3.lib) to the Project Properties -> Configuration Properties -> Linker -> Additional Dependencies.
6. Download SQlite amalgamation with the same version number from http://sqlite.org.
7. Unzip the sqlite3.h header file and place it into the source directory.
You will need to include the sqlite3.dll in the same directory as your program, or in a System Folder.
